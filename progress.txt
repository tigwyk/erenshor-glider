## Codebase Patterns
- Erenshor is a Unity game using BepInEx 5.x (Mono) for modding
- Use Harmony patches to hook into game methods (Prefix/Postfix)
- GameData singleton is the central access point for all game state
- GameData.PlayerControl.transform.position for player coordinates
- GameData.PlayerControl.Myself for player Character reference
- GameData.PlayerControl.CurrentTarget for current target
- Character.MyStats for health/mana/stats access
- Use BepInEx.Configuration for mod settings
- Target .NET Framework 4.7.2 or .NET Standard 2.0

## 2026-02-05 - US-001
- What was implemented:
  - Researched Erenshor's technical architecture
  - Documented Unity engine and BepInEx modding framework
  - Identified key game classes: GameData, Character, PlayerCombat, Hotkeys, Spell, Skill
  - Documented methods for reading game state (position, health, target, combat)
  - Documented methods for sending inputs (auto-attack, abilities, movement)
  - Listed all 6 character classes
- Files changed:
  - docs/technical-integration.md (created)
  - prd.json (committed with project)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Existing mods on GitHub (ErenshorQoL, ExtendedHotbars) are excellent references for API usage
  - GameData is a static singleton - most game state is accessed through it
  - CharacterStats likely has CurrentHP, MaxHP, CurrentMP, MaxMP properties (needs verification)
  - Private methods like Hotkeys.DoHotkeyTask() need reflection to call
  - Movement input simulation may be needed vs direct position manipulation
  - NPC.AggroOn() can be hooked to detect when player is attacked
  - Character.DoDeath() can be hooked to detect deaths
