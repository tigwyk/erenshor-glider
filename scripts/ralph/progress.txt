Branch: ralph/auto-installation
Feature: Automated BepInEx installation and plugin management

## Codebase Patterns
---

## Fri Feb  7 10:30:00 PST 2026 - US-001
- Created installation service infrastructure with IInstallationService interface and InstallationService implementation
- Added IInstallationService.cs with interface, InstallationStatus enum, InstallationResult class, and DownloadProgress class
- Added InstallationService.cs with HttpClient, cache directory management, Steam registry detection, download/install methods
- Added System.IO.Compression and System.Net.Http package references to GUI project
- Files changed:
  - src/ErenshorGlider.GUI/Installation/IInstallationService.cs (new)
  - src/ErenshorGlider.GUI/Installation/InstallationService.cs (new)
  - src/ErenshorGlider.GUI/ErenshorGlider.GUI.csproj (added package references)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - .NET Framework 4.7.2 doesn't support init-only properties - use private setters instead
  - Need to explicitly add System.Net.Http and System.IO.Compression NuGet packages for .NET Framework 4.7.2
  - Nullable reference types require careful handling with `string?` for nullable returns
  - This codebase uses `Nullable` enabled - need to annotate nullable returns properly
  - Cache directory pattern: LocalApplicationData + "ErenshorGlider/cache"
  - Service class follows IDisposable pattern for HttpClient cleanup
