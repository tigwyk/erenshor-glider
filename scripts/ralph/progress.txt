# Ralph Progress Log
Started: Thu Feb  6 09:45:00 PST 2026
Branch: ralph/auto-installation
Feature: Automated BepInEx installation and plugin management

## Codebase Patterns
---

## Fri Feb  7 10:30:00 PST 2026 - US-001
- Created installation service infrastructure with IInstallationService interface and InstallationService implementation
- Added IInstallationService.cs with interface, InstallationStatus enum, InstallationResult class, and DownloadProgress class
- Added InstallationService.cs with HttpClient, cache directory management, Steam registry detection, download/install methods
- Added System.IO.Compression and System.Net.Http package references to GUI project
- Files changed:
  - src/ErenshorGlider.GUI/Installation/IInstallationService.cs (new)
  - src/ErenshorGlider.GUI/Installation/InstallationService.cs (new)
  - src/ErenshorGlider.GUI/ErenshorGlider.GUI.csproj (added package references)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - .NET Framework 4.7.2 doesn't support init-only properties - use private setters instead
  - Need to explicitly add System.Net.Http and System.IO.Compression NuGet packages for .NET Framework 4.7.2
  - Nullable reference types require careful handling with `string?` for nullable returns
  - This codebase uses `Nullable` enabled - need to annotate nullable returns properly
  - Cache directory pattern: LocalApplicationData + "ErenshorGlider/cache"
  - Service class follows IDisposable pattern for HttpClient cleanup

## Fri Feb  7 11:00:00 PST 2026 - US-006
- Implemented GitHub version checking for plugin updates
- Added CheckForUpdatesAsync method to InstallationService that queries GitHub API
- Created UpdateCheckResult class with HasUpdate, LatestVersion, CurrentVersion, ReleaseNotes, and DownloadUrl properties
- Added version comparison logic using System.Version parsing
- Handled offline mode and GitHub API rate limiting gracefully
- Files changed:
  - src/ErenshorGlider.GUI/Installation/IInstallationService.cs (added CheckForUpdatesAsync, UpdateCheckResult)
  - src/ErenshorGlider.GUI/Installation/InstallationService.cs (implemented CheckForUpdatesAsync with GitHub API)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use GitHub API releases/latest endpoint for version checking
  - GitHub API returns 403 Forbidden when rate limited - handle gracefully
  - Use System.Text.Json for JSON parsing (already in dependencies)
  - Version.Parse() requires version format (e.g., "1.0.0"), strip 'v' prefix if present
  - Use null-forgiving operator (!) when compiler can't recognize null check guards
  - Static factory methods pattern (UpdateAvailable, NoUpdate, Failed) for result objects

## Fri Feb  7 11:30:00 PST 2026 - US-007
- Implemented plugin download and update installation
- Added UpdatePluginAsync method that downloads and installs the latest plugin DLL
- Downloads from GitHub releases API, finds ErenshorGlider.dll asset
- Backs up existing DLL before installation (creates .backup file)
- Reports progress during download (0-50%) and installation (50-100%)
- Handles download failures and file lock errors gracefully
- Files changed:
  - src/ErenshorGlider.GUI/Installation/IInstallationService.cs (added UpdatePluginAsync to interface)
  - src/ErenshorGlider.GUI/Installation/InstallationService.cs (implemented UpdatePluginAsync with GitHub download)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Download to temp file in cache directory first, then copy to destination
  - Use HttpCompletionOption.ResponseHeadersRead for streaming large downloads
  - Report progress as percentage of total work (download + install)
  - Backup strategy: copy existing file to .backup before overwriting
  - Clean up temp files after installation (ignore cleanup errors)

## Fri Feb  7 12:00:00 PST 2026 - US-008
- Implemented game process management
- Added IsGameRunning method to check for Erenshor.exe process
- Added LaunchGameAsync method to start the game process
- Created GameLaunchResult class with Success, ErrorMessage, ProcessId properties
- Added GameExited event for process termination notification
- Monitors game process in background thread using ThreadPool
- Files changed:
  - src/ErenshorGlider.GUI/Installation/IInstallationService.cs (added IsGameRunning, LaunchGameAsync, GameExited event, GameLaunchResult)
  - src/ErenshorGlider.GUI/Installation/InstallationService.cs (implemented process management with background monitoring)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use System.Diagnostics.Process.GetProcessesByName() to check if process is running
  - Use ProcessStartInfo with UseShellExecute=true for launching game executables
  - Process monitoring requires background thread - use ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem
  - Track process instance in class field for cleanup and monitoring
  - Dispose process after exit to free resources
